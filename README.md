# Shortest_path_on_graphs
This project was made for a school assignment in order to measure the different speeds of two different methods for solving the single 
source shortest path on weighted graphs. It consists of two files.

GraphGenerator.cpp contains code in order to create a randomly connected and weighted graph with n nodes and m edges.

ShortestPath.cpp contains code to solve for the shortest path on graphs generated by GraphGenerator.cpp and print the time required to 
solve for the shortest path using the two different methods.
